# Data Export
 
This is intended to show 3 possible functions that could be used to import data from an API and export it to an Excel file in a clean, readable format. The 3 functions are required to retrieve the data, process it as required and tidy it.

Note that the API used in this is the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) query database. The API key used in the project is stored in "Secrets.R" with the variable api_key. If a user wants to use the code, user must request an API key at https://database.mma.gov.mv/api and create the required file.
